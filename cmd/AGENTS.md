# Core principles

## UX First
- Commands must be **short, discoverable, and intuitive**
- Error messages must explain **what failed and how to fix it**
- Every command must return a **meaningful exit code**

## Safety by Default
- Defaults must always be **safe**
- Destructive actions require explicit confirmation (`--force`, `--yes`)
- All user input must be validated
